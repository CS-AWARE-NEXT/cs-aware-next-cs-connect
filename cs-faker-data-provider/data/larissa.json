      "description": "The MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) is a fibre optic network with some wireless interconnections. There are two main nodes, four distributors (two of them hosted in the same room with main nodes) and access nodes. In each access node there are end users such as a cultural centre or a municipality\u0027s secondary building. The MAN belongs to the municipality, although other services are using it (permissions are provided by our department) in order to connect their buildings or connect to their main service. So through the MAN the two hospitals of our city are connected, the fire department is connected with its main service and the police department is connected to other services. MAN nodes interact and depend on different services operated by the Municipality of Larissa. For example, from all the access nodes on the Municipal Area Network, nodes 2, 3, 5, 6 and 12 have connections to Genesis and here are therefore potential attack vectors. The nodes of the MAN network where the various departments of Larissa\u0027s municipality are providing services, and what services are provided are listed below. In access node 1 (ΚΠ1), a building that hosts a cultural center and provision services is connected in order to have only Internet access (through syzefxis router in the City Hall). In access node 2, the local community of Terpsithea is connected, in order to have Internet access and connection to the Genesis r710 server. In access node 3, the cemetery is connected, in order to have internet access and connection to the Genesis r710 server. In access node 5, a secondary building is connected, in order to have Internet access and connection to the Genesis and HRMS r710 server. In access node 6, the car depot is connected, in order to have internet access and connection to the Genesis r710 server. In access node 7, a secondary building is connected, in order to have Internet access. In access node 10, a building that hosts the municipality\u0027s radio station is connected, in order to have Internet access. In access node 12, green spaces department is connected, in order to have internet access, connection to the Genesis r710 server and connection to the ACE-ERP r530 server.",

It includes Accounting and Financial Services, Civil Registry etc. 2) (SHR), that includes the tables, indexes, views etc. of our “Human Resources” software named HRMS. These two software packages (Genesis and HRMS), are developed by Singulalogic S.A., a Greek software vendor. GENESIS client application connects to server port 920 (in server SR710) in order to communicate with Genesis’ Application Server (SAS server).

The Cities of Larissa, Elassona and Kileler all use a SYZEFXIS router, as does every other LPA in Greece. SYZEFXIS is connected to both the Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) and to the three servers located in the Town Hall. The City does not control the SYZEFXIS router and cannot monitor the traffic running through SYZEFXIS.",

      "description": "In order to monitor users’ activity, an extra module has been developed, called “Modifications’ history”. Each Genesis module has its own “Modifications’ history” form. In this form, the user can “ask” the database in order to search the database about 3 types of actions: insert, delete and update. The result is a list of records that shows when (date) the action occurred and who (user) committed it. The user can also set these criteria (date range, user) so as to focus his search. Moreover, in the case of the “update” action, the user can see both the old value and the new value of the field that has been updated. “Modifications’ history” is a tool that allows simple Genesis users to execute queries and get results in an understandable way. In some Genesis modules, users can export these results as .xls or .csv files. Administrators, on the other hand, have additional access to the Oracle database (instance name: OTA_DB), its tables and views (schema: S92111) and can retrieve information by using tools like SQL Navigator.",
